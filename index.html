                        "Je pense, donc je suis". What is that, what should I seek, and what do I inspire by? I cannot give an answer since I do not have any. This may be the reason that keeps us going. Think, so that is all I have got, and I think what I truly am. For years, I study philosophy along with others. Most of them are inspiring I found and yet most of them are worthless (perhaps priceless?) I realized. Who will, then, keep on their way to find out what is the meaning of all what we have done, and who will, then, embrace what we are doing no matter what it is? Chances are you never mind, you just another guy who is led to here to find out who I am. Then, "who I am"?

                        Softeware Engineer? That is what they call us, and sometime I even cannot remember what is a software engineer. In my heart, I tend to be a craftsmen, craft beautiful code with best practices of minimalism. Finally like an art, wo an art, who knows how hard it will be? I have no answer. I am small, to be better in the next minute is all I can do. Majored in EE, I coded my way out to a craftsmen of coding. "What a mass", that was my impression for my first job in JAVA. I tried my to find a way to solve any problems. All I can do is to find any solution and try. Then I moved on to an open field of technologies of coding. All these Python, Shell, C, Perl and so on, just kept hitting me, and created this debate of most developer will face - "which language is better, which will be the future, and most importantly which one should I use". As you may already know, this debate will go on and on and never be able to have a conclusion. Then I took a job in this huge insurance company, I started to work with people from all over the world. I started to realize that IT DOESN'T MATTER. No matter what you do, you will end up with solving something you never know. Is the methodology that matters. So I stopped running, and sat down to look at agorithm and patterns. And then I realize they are useful, but not practical. Companies do care about the code. Now I am working with bunch of smart guys. We do coding, we do machine learning, we do frontend, we do gaming, and I want to say we are not lost.
