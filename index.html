                        "Je pense, donc je suis". What is that, what should I ask, and what do I know? I cannot answer since I do not have it. This is the reason keep us going. I think all I have got, and I think what I am. For years, I study philosophy along with others.
                        Most impostant I found and yet most worthless (priceless?) I realized. Who will then still on their path to find out what is the meaning of all what we have done, and who will then embrace what we are doing no matter what it is? Chances are you never
                        mind, you just another guy who is leaded to here to find out who I am. Better ask me: "who you are".

                        With 10 years experiences in software engineer, I have been worked with many orginizations in different industies. From C++ to JAVA, from mill automation control to insurance product, all these experiences have give a stronge skill to accomplish
                        different tasks in any phase of software development cycle. Now I am in a stage of vast and hazy. Looking at the years that passed, I think I knew so much, but feel I know so little. Therefore I never stop learning, and try to stand on the frontier.
                        I am, now, studying Machine Learning. Don't know how this help you, but I do having fun of learning it. I am a big supporter of open source, so feel free to check on my
