                        "Je pense, donc je suis". What is that, what should I seek, and what do I inspire by? I cannot give an answer since I do not have any. This may be the reason that keeps us going. Think, so that is all I have got, and I think what I truly am. For years, I study philosophy along with others. Most of them are inspiring I found and yet most of them are worthless (perhaps priceless?) I realized. Who will, then, keep on their way to find out what is the meaning of all what we have done, and who will, then, embrace what we are doing no matter what it is? Chances are you never mind, you just another guy who is led to here to find out who I am. Then, "who I am"?

                        With 10 years experiences in software engineer, I have been worked with many organizations of different sizes in different industries. From C++ to JAVA, from mill automation control to an insurance product, all these have given me a strong skill to accomplish difficult tasks in any phase of software development cycle. Now I am in a stage of vast and hazy. Looking at the years that passed, I think I knew so much, but feel I know so little. Therefore I never stop learning and try to stand on the frontier. I am, now, studying Machine Learning. Don't know how this will help you, but I do having the fun of learning it. I am a big supporter of open source, so feel free to check on my

                        repository. I will be delighted if you found any of those projects helpful. If you feel like I am someone like you, then hire me. You will not regret.
